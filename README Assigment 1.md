Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the program's correctness.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations.
Adhering to these principles helps create systems that are easier to develop, test, and maintain, ultimately leading to higher-quality software.










Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity in software design involves dividing a software system into distinct modules, each handling specific functionalities and communicating with each other through defined interfaces. This approach enhances both maintainability and scalability of software systems:

Maintainability: By breaking down the system into smaller, self-contained modules, developers can easily understand, modify, and maintain each module independently. This isolation minimizes the risk of unintended side effects and simplifies debugging and troubleshooting processes.

Scalability: Modularity allows the system to adapt to changing requirements or increased workload by adding new modules or extending existing ones. This flexibility enables the system to handle larger datasets, increased user traffic, or additional functionalities without necessitating a complete redesign.

In summary, modularity improves maintainability by simplifying maintenance tasks and enhances scalability by enabling the system to evolve without extensive restructuring.
